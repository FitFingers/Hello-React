# React-Caesar-Cipher
My first foray into using React.

After spendinga  couple of days learning the basics of React on FreeCodeCamp, I set myself the task of rebuilding my JavaScript Caesar Cipher's functionality to solidify what I have (hopefully) learned!

-----

The code itself was very easy to write and didn't take long at all, however one thing that coding bootcamps never teach you is how to implement the code itself onto a webpage: the issue that took the longest to resolve here was definitely trying to get React to render anything on the page at all!
